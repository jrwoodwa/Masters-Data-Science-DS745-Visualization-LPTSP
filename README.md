### Shortest Network Path
Welcome! We set off this network analysis project to find the shortest path between all US state capitols, visiting all capitols once and with one tour. This network optimization problem is crucial for many industry applications:

-	Manufacturing sequencing (e.g., steel, microelectronics)
-	Vehicle routing logistics (e.g., school bus, garbage truck)
-	Automated medical imaging positioning (e.g., MRI, XRAY)

As we explore networks, we will apply linear programming (LP), a robust algorithm. LP is a mathematical method for optimizing an objective while following linear constraints. It formulates problems by linearly adding coefficients and decision variables to achieve a set goal, minimizing or maximizing the objective.
